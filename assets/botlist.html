<h3><span class="emoji">📔 FAQ:<br /></span></h3>
<p><strong><span class="emoji">1) How do I know what items I have unlocked?</span></strong></p>
<p><span class="emoji">Check them with the "/items unlocked" command.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="emoji">2) Why I am losing more money than I am earning?</span></strong></p>
<p><span class="emoji">There might be few reasons. The most common ones are: </span></p>
<p><span class="emoji">a) When selling your items with the "/market sell" command, the current market price for the corresponding item could be very low. Market prices for all of the items are changing every hour. To check the current prices, use one of the following commands: "/items inspect" or "/market view".</span></p>
<p><span class="emoji">b) You are wasting way too many harvests. Every growable item has a harvest duration, that is the time period, while the items can be harvested. If you miss your harvest - items will get rotten and you don't get any rewards for that.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="emoji">3) Why can't I plant more items in my farm?</span></strong></p>
<p><span class="emoji">Your farm has a limited space, where you can plant items. These spacing units are called "tiles". Upon starting the game you get 2 farm tiles. This means, that you can concurrently plant 2 different items or 2 items of the same type. However, these "tiles" are not really related to the actual item volume you will get, when harvesting your farm. You can check what volume of items you will get per tile with the "/items inspect" command. If you have gems, you can upgrade your farm and get more tiles with the "/shop upgrades buy" command.<br /></span></p>
<p><strong><span class="emoji">4) Can I plant items items from my last harvest again? (items from your inventory)</span></strong></p>
<p><span class="emoji">No sorry - not in this game. Planting costs you some constant amount of gold.</span></p>
