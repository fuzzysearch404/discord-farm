Since there are some steps that have to be done manually anyways and
I am not planning to do automatic new instance deployments, I 
will leave these notes for myself for the future and I am
not going to try making an automated script for this in a near future.
There might be stuff missing here or it might not be explained well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

0) Clone repo in the home directory

1) Installing the required software and dependencies:

sudo timedatectl set-timezone UTC

sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

sudo apt install -y python3.9-dev
sudo apt install -y python3-pip
python3.9 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

sudo apt install -y redis-server
 - sudo nano /etc/redis/redis.conf
 - change "supervised no" to "supervised systemd"
 - sudo systemctl restart redis.service

sudo apt install -y postgresql postgresql-contrib
 - sudo su - postgres
 - psql
 - CREATE USER discordfarm WITH PASSWORD 'password'
 - CREATE DATABASE discordfarmdata;
 - quit
 - psql discordfarmdata < schema.sql
    - or load a backup .sql file
 - switch back to the regular user

cd /home/fuzzysearch/discord-farm/
touch ./data/news.txt

3) Configure config.json as per config.example.json example

4) Auto git deployment workflow:

/////
Optional, I have put those in the deployment workflow too.
Sometimes git asks for these and that stops the whole deployment script
/////
git config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"
git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
chmod 700 .ssh/authorized_keys
Copy .ssh/id_rsa.pub contents to authorized_keys
Copy .ssh/id_rsa.pub contents to GitHub user settings SSH keys
Copy .ssh/id_rsa contents to GitHub repo secrets SSH_KEY
Set SSH_HOST (IP address) and SSH_USERNAME secrets on GitHub repo
